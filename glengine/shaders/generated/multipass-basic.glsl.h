    Overview:

        Shader program 'fsq':
            Get shader desc: fsq_shader_desc()
            Vertex shader: vs_fsq
                Attribute slots:
                    ATTR_vs_fsq_pos = 0
            Fragment shader: fs_fsq
                Image 'tex0':
                    Type: SG_IMAGETYPE_2D
                    Component Type: SG_SAMPLERTYPE_FLOAT
                    Bind slot: SLOT_tex0 = 0


    Shader descriptor structs:

        sg_shader fsq = sg_make_shader(fsq_shader_desc());

    Vertex attribute locations for vertex shader 'vs_fsq':

        sg_pipeline pip = sg_make_pipeline(&(sg_pipeline_desc){
            .layout = {
                .attrs = {
                    [ATTR_vs_fsq_pos] = { ... },
                },
            },
            ...});

    Image bind slots, use as index in sg_bindings.vs_images[] or .fs_images[]

        SLOT_tex0 = 0;
