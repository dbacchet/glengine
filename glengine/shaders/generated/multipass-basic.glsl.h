    Shader descriptor structs:

        sg_shader fsq = sg_make_shader(fsq_shader_desc());

    Vertex attribute locations for vertex shader 'vs_fsq':

                },
            },
            ...});

    Image bind slots, use as index in sg_bindings.vs_images[] or .fs_images[]

        SLOT_tex0 = 0;
        SLOT_tex_ssao = 1;
        SLOT_tex_normal = 2;
        SLOT_tex_depth = 3;

    Bind slot and C-struct for uniform block 'fsq_params':

        fsq_params_t fsq_params = {
