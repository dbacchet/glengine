    Overview:

        Shader program 'offscreen_vertexcolor':
            Get shader desc: offscreen_vertexcolor_shader_desc()
            Vertex shader: vs_vertexcolor

                Uniform block 'vs_params':
                    C struct: vs_params_t
                    Bind slot: SLOT_vs_params = 0
            Fragment shader: fs_vertexcolor


    Shader descriptor structs:

        sg_shader offscreen_vertexcolor = sg_make_shader(offscreen_vertexcolor_shader_desc());

    Vertex attribute locations for vertex shader 'vs_vertexcolor':

        sg_pipeline pip = sg_make_pipeline(&(sg_pipeline_desc){
            .layout = {
                .attrs = {
