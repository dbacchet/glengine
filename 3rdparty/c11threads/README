Trivial C11 threads.h implementation over POSIX threads.

Rationale
---------
GNU libc doesn't implement the thread part of the C library from the recent C11
standard, even though recent versions of gcc do support other aspects of it
(like atomics).

If you're starting a new multithreaded project in C right now, it would make
sense to use the standard C way of using threads instead of a mismash of
various platform-specific APIs.

So until the system libc adds support for it, we need a stopgap that works
exactly as the C standard describes.


How to use
----------
No installation, no compilation, just drop c11threads.h to your project, and
don't forget to link with -lpthread

This library is extremely thin and implemented directly in the header file as a
bunch of "static inline" functions (you do have at least C99 functionality while
trying to use C11 threads, right?).

If you'd like to use this with a C89 compiler, just search&replace or
define-away all instances of "inline" to oblivion. Each object file will get a
copy of all those static functions but that shouldn't be too cumbersome for a
reasonably modern system (say anything after the 80s).
